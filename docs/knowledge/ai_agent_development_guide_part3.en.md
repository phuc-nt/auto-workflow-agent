## Introduction

In [Part 1](./ai_agent_development_guide_part1.md) and [Part 2](./ai_agent_development_guide_part2.md), we explored the overall architecture of the Central-Sub Agent system and the internal workings of the Central Agent. Part 3 will delve into the "bottom layer" of the systemâ€”where Sub-agents interact directly with the outside world.

This section focuses on how to effectively implement Sub-agents, especially how to use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create flexible, powerful, and secure Sub-agents.

## 1. Sub-agents in Agent Architecture

### 1.1 Role of Sub-agents

Sub-agents are specialized components in the AI Agent system, each responsible for a specific task and interacting with a particular external system. You can think of Sub-agents as "experts" coordinated by the Central Agent to accomplish complex tasks.

    end

    style SA3 fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
    style SA4 fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
    style SA5 fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
```

### 1.2 Characteristics of Sub-agents

Each ideal Sub-agent should meet the following characteristics:

1. **Specialization**: Focused on a specific domain (Jira, Slack, Calendar...)
2. **Consistent interface**: Provides a standardized interface for easy coordination by the Central Agent
3. **Error handling capability**: Ensures handling of exceptions from external APIs
4. **Interpretation capability**: Converts between natural language and specific API requests
5. **Access control**: Ensures safety when interacting with external systems

### 1.3 Sub-agent Implementation Methods

There are several ways to implement Sub-agents, each with its own pros and cons:

| Method | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **Direct** | Sub-agent directly calls external API | Simple, high control | Dependent on API structure, hard to maintain |
| **SDK/Library** | Uses available library to call API | Leverages tested code, saves time | Dependent on third-party library updates |
| **Function Calling** | Defines functions and lets LLM decide how to call | Flexible, easy to extend | May be inaccurate, hard to control |
| **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** | Standard protocol for AI to interact with external systems | Standardized, secure, flexible | Requires MCP server implementation |

## 2. Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### 2.1 What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that allows AI models to interact with external data sources and systems in a standardized way. MCP solves a critical challenge: how can AI safely and efficiently access and interact with real-world data and functions.

```mermaid
graph LR
    AI["AI Model<br>(Central Agent)"] <--> MC["MCP Client"]
    MC <--> MS["MCP Server"]
    MS <--> BE1["JIRA System"]
    MS <--> BE2["Slack System"]
    MS <--> BE3["Other Systems..."]
    
    style AI fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style MC fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
    style MS fill:#bfb,stroke:#333
```

MCP provides a structured framework to:
- Query data from various sources
- Perform actions on external systems
- Ensure consistency in interactions between AI and systems

### 2.2 Main Components of MCP

The MCP ecosystem includes the following main components:

1. **MCP Client**: Library that allows AI to interact with MCP Server
2. **MCP Server**: Bridge connecting AI requests to backend systems
3. **Transports**: Communication channels between client and server (STDIO, HTTP/SSE, WebSockets)

### 2.3 Core Concepts in MCP

#### 2.3.1 Resources

Resources are the main means for AI to access data in MCP. They are data entities that can be addressed via URI.

```
jira://issues            - List of all issues
jira://issues/PROJ-123   - Details of a specific issue
```

**Characteristics of resources:**
- **Read-only**: Used for querying/reading data, does not change state
- **Structured**: Returned data has consistent structure
- **Filterable**: Usually supports query parameters to filter results

#### 2.3.2 Tools

Tools are functions that allow AI to perform actions that change the system state. Tools are like functions with parameters and return results.

```typescript
// Example tool definition in MCP
{
  name: "createIssue",
  description: "Create a new issue in Jira",
  input: {
    projectKey: "string", // Project key
    summary: "string",    // Issue summary
    description: "string" // Issue description
  }
}
```

**Characteristics of tools:**
- **State-changing**: Used to create, update, or delete data
- **Has parameters**: Requires specific, validated input
- **Returns results**: Notifies the result of the performed action

### 2.4 MCP vs. Function Calling

| Aspect | MCP | Function Calling |
|--------|-----|------------------|
| **Standardization** | Standard protocol, consistent across applications | Depends on specific implementation |
| **Data types** | Resources and Tools | Functions with input/output |
| **Interaction** | Two-way, supports streaming | Usually one-off call |
| **Scope** | Designed as an open, cross-platform protocol | Usually tied to a specific LLM |
| **Security** | Supports access control and limits | Depends on implementation |

## 3. Implementing Sub-agents with MCP

### 3.1 Sub-agent Architecture and Communication Process with MCP

MCP Sub-agents are built with a standardized architecture that simultaneously allows separation of processing logic and simplification of API interactions. Below are two diagrams illustrating both the static structure and dynamic communication flow during request processing.

```mermaid
graph TD
    AgentCoord["Agent Coordinator"] --> SubAgent
    subgraph "Sub Agent with MCP"
        SubAgent["McpJiraAgent"] --> MCPClient
        SubAgent --> Processor["Prompt Processor"]
    end
        MCPClient["MCP Client"] --> MCPServer["MCP Server"]
        MCPServer --> API["Jira API"]
    
    style AgentCoord fill:#f96,stroke:#333
    style SubAgent fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
    style MCPClient fill:#bfb,stroke:#333
    style MCPServer fill:#bfb,stroke:#333
```

Each component in the system has a clearly defined role:

- **Agent Coordinator**: Routes requests to the appropriate specialized Sub-agent
- **Prompt Processor**: Converts natural language into intents and entities
- **MCP Client**: Connects and sends requests to MCP Server according to MCP standards
- **MCP Server**: Transforms MCP requests into corresponding API calls

The processing flow of a request is detailed in the following sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant AC as Agent Coordinator
    participant SA as Sub-agent
    participant PP as Prompt Processor
    participant MC as MCP Client
    participant MS as MCP Server
    participant API as External API
    
    Note over AC: Receives request from Action Planner
    AC->>SA: executePrompt("Find all open issues in project PROJ")
    Note over AC: Analyzes and routes request
    SA->>PP: Semantic analysis (project=PROJ, status=open)
    PP-->>SA: Identifies appropriate resource/tool
    
    alt Reading data (Resource)
        SA->>MC: readResource("jira://issues?project=PROJ&status=open")
        MC->>MS: HTTP GET with URI and params
        MS->>API: GET /rest/api/3/search?jql=...
        API-->>MS: JSON response
    else Performing action (Tool)
        SA->>MC: executeTool("createIssue", {...})
        MC->>MS: HTTP POST with tool params
        MS->>API: POST /rest/api/3/issue
        API-->>MS: Response
    end
    
    MS-->>MC: Structured data
    MC-->>SA: Processing result
    SA-->>AC: StepResult
    Note over AC: Processes result and returns to Action Planner
```

Key features of the MCP Sub-agent architecture:

1. **Language transformation**: Automatically analyzes natural language requests into MCP commands
2. **Separation of concerns**: Sub-agent logic is separated from API details
3. **Interface standardization**: Unified communication protocol between systems
4. **Read/write support**: Simultaneously supports data querying and action performance
5. **Security**: Precise access control down to individual resources/tools

### 3.2 Benefits of MCP-based Sub-agents

1. **Separation of concerns**: MCP separates Sub-agent logic from API connection details
2. **Consistent interface**: Sub-agents have a unified interface regardless of external system
3. **Scalability**: Easily add new resources/tools without affecting Central Agent
4. **Higher security**: Precisely control data and actions AI can perform
5. **Reusability**: MCP Server can be used by multiple AI applications
