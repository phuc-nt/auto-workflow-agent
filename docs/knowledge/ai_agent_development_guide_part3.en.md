## Introduction

In [Part 1](./ai_agent_development_guide_part1.md) and [Part 2](./ai_agent_development_guide_part2.md), we explored the overall architecture of the Central-Sub Agent system and the details of the Central Agent's operation. Part 3 delves into the "bottom layer" of the systemâ€”where Sub-agents interact directly with the outside world.

This section focuses on how to implement Sub-agents effectively, especially how to use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create flexible, powerful, and secure Sub-agents.

## 1. Sub-agents in Agent Architecture

### 1.1 Role of Sub-agents

Sub-agents are specialized components in the AI Agent system, each responsible for a specific task and interacting with a particular external system. You can think of Sub-agents as "experts" coordinated by the Central Agent to accomplish complex tasks.

    style SA3 fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
    style SA4 fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
    style SA5 fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
```

### 1.2 Characteristics of Sub-agents

An ideal Sub-agent should have the following characteristics:

1. **Specialization**: Focused on a specific domain (Jira, Slack, Calendar, etc.)
2. **Consistent Interface**: Provides a standardized interface for easy coordination by the Central Agent
3. **Error Handling**: Ensures handling of exceptions from external APIs
4. **Interpretation Ability**: Translates between natural language and specific API requests
5. **Access Control**: Ensures safety when interacting with external systems

### 1.3 Sub-agent Implementation Methods

There are several ways to implement Sub-agents, each with its own pros and cons:

| Method | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **Direct** | Sub-agent calls external API directly | Simple, high control | Dependent on API structure, hard to maintain |
| **SDK/Library** | Uses available libraries to call API | Leverages tested code, saves time | Dependent on third-party library updates |
| **Function Calling** | Defines functions and lets LLM decide how to call | Flexible, easy to extend | May be inaccurate, hard to control |
| **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** | Standard protocol for AI to interact with external systems | Standardized, secure, flexible | Requires MCP server implementation |

## 2. Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### 2.1 What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that allows AI models to interact with external data sources and systems in a standardized way. MCP solves a key challenge: how can AI safely and efficiently access and interact with real-world data and functions.

```mermaid
graph LR
    AI["AI Model<br>(Central Agent)"] <--> MC["MCP Client"]
    MC <--> MS["MCP Server"]
    MS <--> BE1["JIRA System"]
    MS <--> BE2["Slack System"]
    MS <--> BE3["Other Systems..."]
    
    style AI fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style MC fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
    style MS fill:#bfb,stroke:#333
```

MCP provides a structured framework to:
- Query data from multiple sources
- Perform actions on external systems
- Ensure consistency in interactions between AI and external systems

### 2.2 Why MCP?

MCP is designed to address common challenges in AI and external system integration:

- **Standardization**: A consistent way for AI to communicate with any external system
- **Security**: Safe access to external data and functions, with fine-grained control
- **Flexibility**: Easily adaptable to different APIs and data sources
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for performance, reducing latency in AI responses

### 2.3 Core Concepts in MCP

#### 2.3.1 Resources

Resources are the main way for AI to access data in MCP. They are data entities addressable via URI.

```
jira://issues            - List of all issues
jira://issues/PROJ-123   - Details of a specific issue
```

**Characteristics of resources:**
- **Read-only**: Used for querying/reading data, does not change state
- **Structured**: Returned data has a consistent structure
- **Filterable**: Often supports query parameters to filter results

#### 2.3.2 Tools

Tools are functions that allow AI to perform actions that change the system state. Tools are like functions with parameters and return results.

```typescript
// Example tool definition in MCP
{
  name: "createIssue",
  description: "Create a new issue in Jira",
  input: {
    projectKey: "string", // Project key
    summary: "string",    // Issue title
    description: "string" // Issue description
  }
}
```

**Characteristics of tools:**
- **State-changing**: Used to create, update, or delete data
- **Has parameters**: Requires specific validated input
- **Returns results**: Notifies the outcome of the action

### 2.4 MCP vs. Function Calling

| Aspect | MCP | Function Calling |
|--------|-----|------------------|
| **Standardization** | Consistent protocol | Implementation-dependent |
| **Data Types** | Resources and Tools | Function input/output |
| **Interaction** | Bidirectional, supports streaming | Usually one-off calls |
| **Scope** | Designed as an open, cross-platform protocol | Often tied to a specific LLM |
| **Security** | Access control and restrictions | Implementation-dependent |

## 3. Implementing Sub-agents with MCP

### 3.1 Sub-agent Architecture with MCP

```mermaid
graph TD
    AgentCoord["Agent Coordinator"] --> SubAgent
    subgraph "Sub Agent with MCP"
        SubAgent["McpJiraAgent"] --> MCPClient
        SubAgent --> Processor["Prompt Processor"]
    end
        MCPClient["MCP Client"] --> MCPServer["MCP Server"]
        MCPServer --> API["Jira API"]
    
    style AgentCoord fill:#f96,stroke:#333
    style SubAgent fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
    style MCPClient fill:#bfb,stroke:#333
    style MCPServer fill:#bfb,stroke:#333
```

Key features of this architecture:
1. Agent Coordinator calls Sub-agent with a natural language command
2. Sub-agent uses Prompt Processor to analyze the request
3. Sub-agent determines which MCP resource/tool to call
4. MCP Client sends the request to MCP Server
5. MCP Server interacts with the real API
6. Results are returned in reverse order

### 3.2 Benefits of MCP-based Sub-agents

1. **Separation of concerns**: MCP separates Sub-agent logic from API connection details
2. **Consistent interface**: Sub-agents have a unified interface regardless of external systems
3. **Scalability**: Easily add new resources/tools without affecting the Central Agent
4. **Higher security**: Precisely control data and actions AI can perform
5. **Reusability**: MCP Server can be used by multiple AI applications

### 3.3 MCP Sub-agent Communication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CA as Central Agent
    participant SA as Sub-agent
    participant MC as MCP Client
    participant MS as MCP Server
    participant API as External API
    
    CA->>SA: executePrompt("Find all issues in project PROJ")
    SA->>SA: Analyze request
    SA->>MC: readResource("jira://issues?project=PROJ")
    MC->>MS: Send resource request
    MS->>API: GET /rest/api/3/search?jql=project=PROJ
    API-->>MS: Return list of issues
    MS-->>MC: Return structured data
    MC-->>SA: Issue data
    SA-->>CA: StepResult with issue list
```

This flow shows how MCP converts natural language requests into specific API calls, and vice versa, converting API results into structured data that AI can understand.
